# LBJ Console

LBJ Console is an Android app designed to receive and display LBJ messages via BLE from the [SX1276_Receive_LBJ](https://github.com/undef-i/SX1276_Receive_LBJ) device.

## Roadmap
- Record filtering (train number, time range)
- Record management page optimization
- Optional train merge by locomotive/number
